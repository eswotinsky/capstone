      <p>
        Zazu’s House operates 100% with an all-volunteer staff and NO administrative salaries or paid directors. We run on a very tight budget, and even a $10 donation can make a big difference for our birds!
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the inception of its 501(c)3 charitable organization status in 2008,  Zazu’s House has been a place of refuge for many neglected and abused parrots.  We provide the care needed to allow these animals to thrive in a secure and loving environment for the rest of their lives
